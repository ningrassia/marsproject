CS 559 Project 2 Repo!

TODO:
EVERYTHING

Structure stuff:
Files/Object
Mars
Ship
Starfield
Mesh - parent class


Bonus ideas:
Ship movement
Collision for ship/mars? - constant distance from planet or super-fancy physics or both?
Utah teapot somewhere?
texture mars?
Starbucks.
Modify mars mesh on-the-fly - environment destruction? shoot mountains away?
Adjust scaling factor of Mars - how jagged can we make it?
Shadow?
Spaceship mounted light?

CODING STANDARDS:
Variables named with underscore, all lowercase
	e.g.: int scooter_count
Functions named in camelcase, uppercase first word
	e.g.: void AddWheel()
Curly brackets: you like to do next line. I like to do same line except for functions.
	...we'll talk about that one.
